            <p>â€œThe whole trip was amazing, I really loved all of the times we had to bond with each other and with nature. I learned a lot about the people who went on the trip with me, and also how to preserve the natural world. I had no idea that microplastics were so prevalent and the importance that came with not leaving any behind. The trip really motivated me to have a healthier lifestyle, and all in all, I learned a lot about nature and myself."</p>
